<h1>JAVA ERROR HANDLING</h1>

<p>In general, errors can be broken up into two categories:
Design-time errors and Logical errors. Design-time errors are easy to spot
because NetBeans usually underlines them. If the error will prevent the programme
from running, NetBeans will underline it in red. Logical errors are the ones that
you make as a programmer. The programme will run but, because you did something
wrong with the coding, there's a good chance the entire thing will crash.
You'll see examples of run-time errors shortly. You'll also see how to handle them.
But first a word on how Java handles errors.</p>
