<h1>JAVA AND INHERITANCE</h1>

<p>Another important concept in Object Oriented programming is Inheritance.
Just what Inheritance is will become clearer with some programming examples.
But essentially, it's having one class as a parent class (called a super class)
and another class as a child of the parent (the sub class).
The child class is said to be derived from the parent class.
The reason to have a child class, though, is to keep information separate.
The child can inherit all the methods and fields from its parent,
but can then do its own thing.</p>
