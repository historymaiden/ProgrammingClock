<h1>WHILE LOOPS</h1>

<p>Another type of loop you can use in Java is called the while loop.
While loops are a lot easier to understand than for loops. Here's what
they look like:</p>

<p><b>
    while ( condition ) {
</b></p>

<p><b>
    }
</b></p>
So you start with the word "while" in lowercase. The condition you
want to test for goes between round brackets. A pair of curly brackets
comes next, and the code you want to execute goes between the curly brackets.
As an example, here's a while loop that prints out some text (Try the code out
for yourself):
</b></p>
<p><b>
int loopVal = 0;</b></p>
<p><b>
while ( loopVal < 5) {</b></p>
<p><b>
System.out.println("Printing Some Text");</b></p>
<p><b>
loopVal++;</b></p>
}

<p>Again, Java will loop round and round until the end condition is met.
This time, the "while" part is at the bottom. But the condition is the same -
keep looping while the value inside of the variable called loopVal is less than
5. The difference between the two is the code between the curly brackets of do …
while will get executed at least once. With the while loop, the condition could
already be met. Java will then just bail out of your loop, and not even execute
your curly bracket code. To test this out, try the while loop first. Change the
value of your loopVal variable to 5, and then run the code. You should find that
the text doesn't get printed. Now try the do loop with a value of 5 for loopVal.
The text will print once and then Java will bail out of the loop.</p>
