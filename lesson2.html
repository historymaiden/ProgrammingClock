<h1>JAVA ARRAYS</h1>

<p>Programmes work by manipulating data placed in memory.
The data can be numbers, text, objects, pointers to other memory areas,
and more besides. The data is given a name, so that it can be re-called
whenever it is need. The name, and its value, is known as a Variable.
We'll start with number values.</p>

<p>
    To store a number in java, you have lots of options.
    Whole numbers such as 8, 10, 12, etc, are stored using the int variable.
    (The int stands for integer.) Floating point numbers like 8.4, 10.5, 12.8,
    etc, are stored using the double variable. You do the storing with an equals
    sign ( = ). Let's look at some examples (You can use your FirstProject code
    for these examples).
