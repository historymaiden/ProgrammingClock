<h1>CONDITIONAL LOGIC - IF STATEMENTS</h1>

<p>The programming you're doing now is sequential programming,
meaning the code is executed from top to bottom. It's very linear,
in that each and every line of code will be read, starting with the
first line of code you write and ending at the last line.</p>

<p>
   But you don't always want your programmes to work like that.
   Often, you want code to be executed only if certain conditions are met.
   For example, you might want one message to display if a user is below the
   age of 18 and a different message if he or she is 18 or older.
   You want to control the flow of the programme for yourself. You can do this
   with conditional logic.
