<h1>JAVA PROGRAMMING FOR KIDS, PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS</h1>

<p>This website is for kids from 11 to 80 years old. </p>

<p>This website is great for parents who want to get their child into the world of computer programming - the real one, not the reader-rabbit-kind-of-world. </p>

<p>This website is for college students who are looking for a supplement to overcomplicated textbooks. </p>

<p>This website is easy enough for complete beginners of all ages.</p>

<h2>JAVA COMMENTS</h2>
<p>When you create a New Project in NetBeans, you'll notice that some text is
greyed out, with lots of slashes and asterisks: </p>

<img border="0" src="http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/java/images/started/coding_windowC.gif" width="492" height="467" alt="The Java coding window" border="1">
<P>
The greyed-out areas are comments. When the programme runs, comments are ignored.
So you can type whatever you want inside of your comments. But it's usual to have
comments that explain what is you're trying to do. You can have a single line
comment by typing two slashes, followed by your comment:
</P>

<p><B>
   //This is a single line comment 
</B></p>
<p>
    
</p>
<P>
    If you want to have more than one line, you can either do this:
</P>
<P><B>
    //This is a comment spreading
</B></P>
<P><B>
   //over two lines or more 
</B></P>
<p>
    Or you can do this:
</p>
<P><B>
    /*
</B></P>
<P><B>
    This is a comment spreading
</B></P>
<P><B>
    over two lines or more
</B></P>
<P><B>
    */
